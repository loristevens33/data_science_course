The objective of this project is to create and evaluate statistical models to predict wine quality using the Wine Quality datasets available in the UCI repository. The datasets are inclusive of “Vinho Verde” red and white wine from Portugal. This is a collection of 6,500 ratings released in October 2009.

The full dataset is available at the following location:
